Fragment Navigation App (Java)

This Android project demonstrates fragment navigation with two fragments. The app shows the first fragment by default, and users can navigate to the second fragment by clicking a button, with the ability to return to the first fragment.
Features:

    Fragment Navigation: Displays the first fragment initially and navigates to the second fragment on button click.
    Back Navigation: Provides a smooth transition back to the first fragment.
    Dynamic UI Updates: Each fragment displays different content, showcasing how to manage fragment transactions.

Technologies:

    Language: Java
    Fragments: Android's FragmentManager and FragmentTransaction for managing navigation between fragments
    Navigation: Button-based navigation between fragments

Usage:

Clone the repository, open it in Android Studio, and run it on an Android emulator or device. The app will load the first fragment by default. Clicking the button will take the user to the second fragment, and navigating back will return to the first fragment.
